# Industrial Newcoming

This is a mod-like datapack for Minecraft 1.16

THIS PROJECT IS A WIP AS OF YET, ANY AND ALL FILES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TEMPORARY OR UNFIT FOR USE

# Info

This datapack is meant for Minecraft Java 1.16, I recommend at least 4GB of RAM and a decent computer at least. See <a href="https://github.com/HighpixleGaming/industrial_newcoming/blob/master/README.md#installation">Installation</a>

Most of the machines in this pack are made with entities, so be wary when using on a server.

There is a wiki for any and all features I add to the pack for ease of use.
